                    MakerBot Bowden Extruder
                    Filament Drive Mechanism

Design Parameters
-----------------
1. Each filament drive mechanism will drive a single filament.
2. A magnetic encoder can be fixed at the shaft's end. The encoder board
   design can be changed based on the filament drive mechanism.
3. The design should be easilly adaptable to both 3 mm and 0.7 inch filament.


Notes
-----
1. Use the encoder design in svn.
2. The coupling mechanism is in plastruder trunk.
3. Filament roll dimensions: OD 11", ID 5.5", depth 4".
4. MW dimensions: h 12", w 18", depth 12" (can be changed if necessary)
5. Prototype filament drive mechanism due 12 January 2010.
6. Made from
   5.5 mm Acrylic (the MakerBot stuff. Might be 0.22")
